# Scripts

The whole idea of this project is to provide the interface for custom scripts to be able to run oracle queries in the restrictive and agile manner. You can create customs scripts without worrying about handeling database connections.
 
 **Imporatant: Any script execution has to be called from the root of the project**
 ```

Connection Test Succesful.
